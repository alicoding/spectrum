# Nodejs Express Mongoose Demo

This is a demo node.js application illustrating various features used in everyday web development, with a fine touch of best practices. The demo app is a blog application where users (signing up using facebook, twitter, github and simple registrations) can create an article, delete an article and add comments on the article.

Read the [wiki](https://github.com/madhums/node-express-mongoose/wiki) (or the [old blog post](http://madhums.me/2012/07/19/breaking-down-app-js-file-nodejs-express-mongoose/)) for the application architecture.

Want to build something from scratch? use the [boilerplate app](https://github.com/madhums/node-express-mongoose)

## Install

**NOTE:** You need to have node.js, mongodb and [imagemagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php) installed and running.

```sh
  $ git clone git://github.com/madhums/nodejs-express-mongoose-demo.git
  $ npm install
  $ cp config/config.example.js config/config.js
  $ cp config/imager.example.js config/imager.js
  $ npm start
```

**NOTE:** Do not forget to update your facebook twitter and github APP_ID and APP_SECRET in `config/config.js`. Also if you want to use image uploads, don't forget to replace the S3 and Rackspace keys in `config/imager.js`.

Then visit [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)
